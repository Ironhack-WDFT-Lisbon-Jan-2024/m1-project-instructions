# Project #1 - The Game!

## The Goal üéØ

Create a game that combines your new **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** skills! This project is to be done in pairs, decided by you!

You'll need to send me a message on slack informing me of your group by next monday Oct 30!

## Important Dates üóìÔ∏è

### Pitch Presentation: 26-01-2024

The group will need to present their game idea to the Teachers. Remember that you should answer this questions: 

<ol>
<li><b>Idea Description</b></li>
<ul>
<li>What's your game about? How is it played? What is your project MVP?</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Game Logic (Technical Answers)</b></li>
<ul>
<li>How do you plan to implement the game logic? How will you make your player move? How will you create the obstacles? How does the game end?</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Extra Features</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Which extra features do you plan to implement in your game after you finish your MVP?</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Technical Challenges</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Which logic/feature do you believe will be more challenging to implement?</li>
</ul>
</ol>

### Project Start: 29-01-2024

We officially begin our project development!

### MVP and Deploy: 31-01-2024

You'll present your MVP - Minimum Viable Product - to the LT and CTA. MVP means you should have a working game and everything you do after this point is adding **sugar**. After the MVPs we'll deploy the games together in order to have enough time to fix any problems that might appear after the deploy.

### Project Presentation: 02-02-2024

You'll present your game for everyone! At the end the class will vote on the projects in 4 categories: **Most Aesthetically Pleasing, Most Challenging Coding Wise, Most Original Idea** and **Best Overall!** More info on the presentation below.

We gather in circle and every group should answer the following questions:

We'll focus totally in developing the projects and me and Mariana will be here to help you! Every time you need help, you'll use the ticketing system from the #ft_web_jan24_help.
